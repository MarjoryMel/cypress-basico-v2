# Testes automatizados com Cypress - BÃ¡sico

Repository for the basic Cypress course from the Talking About Testing School.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v18.15.0` and `9.5.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

To open Cypress in interactive mode with a mobile device resolution, run `npm run cy:open:mobile`.

To run the tests in headless mode with a mobile device resolution, run `npm run test:mobile`.
